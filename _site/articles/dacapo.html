<h1 id="da-capo">Da Capo</h1>

<p><strong>Da Capo</strong> is a dual-purpose café and bar on the Upper West Side that blends old-world espresso culture with modern cocktail sensibilities. By day, it functions as a sleek espresso bar with a selection of classic coffee offerings and Italian pastries. By night, it shifts into an atmospheric cocktail bar and restaurant, complete with a full dinner menu and a rotating lineup of creative drinks.</p>

<p>I visited Da Capo with a friend, and though it wasn’t planned around anything in particular, it turned out to be a great spot to just hang out and talk. The interior has an industrial-modern aesthetic, with warm lighting, clean lines, and a relaxed tone that doesn’t feel forced.</p>

<h2 id="the-back-room">The Back Room</h2>

<p>One of the more unique features of Da Capo is the back room—an enclosed seating area tucked behind the main café. The ceiling is partially translucent, letting in a soft natural light that makes the space feel open without being exposed. It’s easy to imagine how great it would be on a summer afternoon with the sunlight pouring in.</p>

<p>It’s quiet, low-key, and feels like a little retreat from the pace of the city. Perfect for catching up, reading, or just sipping something slowly.</p>

<h2 id="why-claire-should-go">Why Claire Should Go</h2>

<p>It’s not necessarily the kind of place you’d find on a trending café list, but that’s part of the appeal. Da Capo isn’t trying to be flashy—it’s just doing everything <em>well</em>. Great drinks, good design, and a space that feels considered. The kind of place that doesn’t need to be loud to be memorable.</p>

<p>Claire would love the balance of function and atmosphere here—especially the back room, which has that plant-lit serenity she tends to gravitate toward.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> One of the better Upper West Side surprises. Definitely worth a summer return.</p>
