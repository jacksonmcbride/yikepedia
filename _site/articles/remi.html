<h1 id="remi43">Remi43</h1>

<p>Remi43 is part café, part flower shop, and entirely Claire-coded. She recommended it to me knowing how much I love interiors with plants—and Remi43 <em>delivers</em>. There are plants everywhere: hanging from the ceiling, tucked into corners, growing in the windows, even perched on the counter. It feels less like a coffee shop and more like a greenhouse that happens to serve lattes.</p>

<h2 id="the-lavender-latte">The Lavender Latte</h2>

<p>I ordered the <strong>lavender latte</strong>, which came out looking like a Pinterest post brought to life. It had this soft purple hue, a subtle latte art flourish, and a few sprigs of real lavender sprinkled on top for good measure. The taste? Genuinely impressive. You could actually <em>taste</em> the lavender, not in an artificial syrupy way, but in a fragrant, floral way that felt… peaceful.</p>

<p>At the very end, I accidentally bit into one of the lavender buds—which was surprisingly cool. It’s a strange experience, tasting something that smells exactly like a candle aisle, but I mean that in the best way. I happen to love lavender, so it worked for me.</p>

<p>I wanted to try the <strong>rose latte</strong> too, mostly out of curiosity, but didn’t get the chance.</p>

<h2 id="the-one-catch">The One Catch</h2>

<p>I was only there for maybe 15 minutes.</p>

<p>The space is beautiful, but <strong>tiny</strong>. And very popular. By the time I finished my drink, there was still nowhere to sit, so I gave up my spot and relocated to the Columbia Libraries to actually get some work done.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Remi43 is visually stunning and creatively ambitious. The drinks are floral, the vibe is lush, and the aesthetic is unmatched. But unless you go at an off-hour or get very lucky, seating can be a real issue.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> 5/10<br />
Absolutely worth visiting—but maybe plan on taking your drink to-go.</p>
