<h1 id="bel-ami">Bel Ami</h1>

<p>If Claire is excited about something, it’s usually worth paying attention to. And that was definitely the case with <strong>Bel Ami</strong>. She’d been hyping up the pastries for a while, and when someone hypes up pastries that much, you start to wonder if they can really live up to it.</p>

<p>They did.</p>

<h2 id="the-food">The Food</h2>

<p>We stopped by Bel Ami after spending the afternoon at <a href="/yikepedia/articles/levygorvy">Levy Gorvy Dayan</a>, and it felt like the perfect wind-down. Claire ordered something mysterious and chocolatey—no clue what it was called, but it tasted amazing. Rich and indulgent, but not overly sweet.</p>

<p>The real standout, though, was the <strong>pastry</strong>. Flaky doesn’t even begin to describe it—you could see the individual folds and layers like a stack of paper-thin secrets. Light on the inside, perfectly crisp on the outside. It was the kind of pastry you take a bite of and instinctively look back at, like: <em>did that really just happen?</em></p>

<h2 id="atmosphere">Atmosphere</h2>

<p>Bel Ami has a cozy, tucked-away feel—kind of like one of those places that seems to exist just outside the rush of the city. The café wasn’t too crowded when we went, and we ended up staying for a while, just sitting and talking. It was one of those low-stakes, high-reward hangouts where time kind of drifts.</p>

<p>There was something really comforting about it. Maybe it was the lighting. Or maybe it was just Claire.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Bel Ami probably won’t blow your mind with novelty, but it nails the simple things—and sometimes that’s all you need. It was the perfect pit stop between art and the rest of the day, and definitely a place I’d go back to for another pastry fix.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> 7/10<br />
A quiet win. Great pastries, even better company.</p>
