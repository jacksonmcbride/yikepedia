# Restaurants Visited

This page presents a categorized record of restaurants visited across New York City, primarily selected or inspired by Claire. Each entry links to a detailed review and reflects a shared experience—usually one that started with a casual "I know a place" and ended in a full-blown memory.

Claire's taste leans toward the intuitive and occasionally flawless, and this list stands as subtle (and delicious) proof.

## Overview

Restaurants listed here span a range of styles, from cozy brunch cafés to rustic trattorias and bold Brooklyn Sichuan. The common thread among them is Claire's uncanny ability to pick the exact right place for the mood—even when that mood involves Tet noodles, espresso cocktails, or fried chicken at midnight.

Each location has been reviewed based on food quality, ambiance, and the ineffable vibe of the moment.

### 1. **Modern & Global Cuisine**

- **[La Mercerie]({{ '/articles/la-mercerie' | relative_url }})**  
  *Cuisine:* French Café & Restaurant  
  *Known for:* Buckwheat Crêpe Complète & Quiche  
  *Rating:* 8.5/10  
  A sophisticated French café within the Roman and Williams Guild. The space seamlessly blends high-end furniture with dining, creating a unique atmosphere. The quiche is a must-try, and the crêpe complète offers a perfect balance of flavors.

- **[Tournesol]({{ '/articles/tournesol' | relative_url }})**  
  *Cuisine:* French Bistro  
  *Known for:* Duck Breast & Escargot  
  *Rating:* 8.75/10  
  A charming slice of Paris in Long Island City. The intimate setting and authentic French cuisine make it a perfect spot for a romantic dinner. The duck breast is a revelation, and the escargot is not to be missed.

- **[Madame Vo]({{ '/articles/madame-vos' | relative_url }})**  
  *Cuisine:* Modern Vietnamese  
  *Known for:* Tet Noodles & Beef Pho  
  *Rating:* 9/10  
  A sleek East Village spot where the Tet noodles might change your life. A surprise find after a night out that somehow felt perfectly planned. Possibly the most memorable noodles of the year.

- **[Pylos]({{ '/articles/pylos' | relative_url }})**  
  *Cuisine:* Greek  
  *Known for:* Moussaka & Brizola Steak  
  *Rating:* 8/10  
  A stylish East Village Greek restaurant with a stunning ceiling of hanging terracotta pots. The elevated comfort food and warm atmosphere make it perfect for a spring evening. The steak is a must-try.

- **[Birds of a Feather]({{ '/articles/birds' | relative_url }})**  
  *Cuisine:* Sichuan Chinese  
  *Known for:* Curiously Tasty Chicken & Poached Wontons  
  *Rating:* 9/10  
  A stylish Williamsburg Sichuan spot that delivered on spice, flavor, and atmosphere. Shared plates, shared laughs, and a shared sense that the place just got it right.

- **[Menkoi Sato]({{ '/articles/menkoi' | relative_url }})**  
  *Cuisine:* Japanese Ramen  
  *Known for:* Curry Ramen & Fried Chicken  
  *Rating:* 8/10  
  Loud, fast-paced, and incredibly fun. The fried chicken is essential. Bonus points for being on the street that inspired a Taylor Swift song (according to Claire, which means it's probably true).

### 2. **Bakery & Brunch Staples**

- **[Effy's Cafe]({{ '/articles/effys' | relative_url }})**  
  *Cuisine:* Israeli-American Brunch  
  *Known for:* Bagel Sandwiches & Lemon-Prawn Salad  
  *Rating:* 8.5/10  
  A quiet Upper East Side gem with no-frills charm and unexpectedly excellent food. The bagels were great, but the company made it better.

- **[Martha's Country Bakery]({{ '/articles/marthas' | relative_url }})**  
  *Cuisine:* American Bakery  
  *Known for:* Raspberry Cheesecake & Mousse Cakes  
  *Rating:* 9/10  
  A post-lunch sugar stop that turned into a full-fledged pastry event. Sweet, cozy, and a little romantic if you squint between bites of passionfruit mousse.

- **[Ruby's Cafe]({{ '/articles/rubys-cafe' | relative_url }})**  
  *Cuisine:* Australian Brunch  
  *Known for:* Bronte Burger  
  *Rating:* 7.2/10  
  Packed, charming, and the kind of place where everyone somehow looks cooler than you. The burger lives up to the hype. The conversations that happened over it might've been even better.

### 3. **Classic Date Night Energy**

- **[Olio e Più]({{ '/articles/olioepiu' | relative_url }})**  
  *Cuisine:* Italian Trattoria  
  *Known for:* Spaghetti alla Carbonara & Carpaccio di Polipo  
  *Rating:* 9.5/10  
  Rustic elegance tucked into the West Village. Every dish felt like it had a story, and the candlelight didn't hurt. Very strong contender for best indoor ambiance—possibly best everything.
