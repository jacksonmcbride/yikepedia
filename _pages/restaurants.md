# Restaurants Visited

This page presents a categorized record of restaurants visited across New York City, primarily selected or inspired by Claire. Each entry links to a detailed review and reflects a shared experience—usually one that started with a casual "I know a place" and ended in a full-blown memory.

Claire's taste leans toward the intuitive and occasionally flawless, and this list stands as subtle (and delicious) proof.

## Overview

Restaurants listed here span a range of styles, from cozy brunch cafés to rustic trattorias and bold Brooklyn Sichuan. The common thread among them is Claire's uncanny ability to pick the exact right place for the mood—even when that mood involves Tet noodles, espresso cocktails, or fried chicken at midnight.

Each location has been reviewed based on food quality, ambiance, and the ineffable vibe of the moment.

## Notes

- Reviews reflect personal experiences and should not be taken as definitive assessments—though Claire's taste has yet to be wrong.
- Scores are subjective, but moments are real.
- This page is updated as new meals happen, memories are made, and recommendations keep rolling in.
