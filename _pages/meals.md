- **[Drumsticks, Brussels Sprouts, and Shrimp]({{ '/articles/drumsticks-041825' | relative_url }})**
  A hearty trio that balanced comfort and complexity. The drumsticks were seasoned to perfection—crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. The brussels sprouts added a caramelized crunch, and the shrimp, lightly spiced, brought in a surprising brightness. A particularly well-rounded meal that showcased Claire's ability to cook across textures and proteins with ease.
