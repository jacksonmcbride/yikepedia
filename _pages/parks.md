# Public Parks Visited

This page documents public parks visited throughout New York City—typically as spontaneous detours or sunset destinations, often following a meal, a walk, or a Claire-led plan. While modest in number, each outing felt curated and grounded in shared presence.

Claire has an eye for these spaces—the kind of places where the city quiets just enough to hear your own thoughts (or someone else's). These are the parks that framed some of our best conversations, longest walks, and most quietly meaningful afternoons.

## Overview

The parks listed below offer a blend of architectural interest, skyline views, and reflective calm. Whether rowing through still waters or improvising music on public chimes, each visit served as both an escape and a reminder that time moves differently when you're with the right person.

### Iconic Parks

- **[Central Park]({{ '/articles/centralpark' | relative_url }})**  
  *Location:* Central Park, Manhattan  
  *Known for:* Row boats, Citibikes, spring light  
  *Rating:* 8.5/10  
  A full-day adventure that felt both cinematic and grounding. From sunbathing turtles to a spontaneous rowing shouting mathc, this visit had just the right blend of movement, laughter, and meaningful quiet. One of the most complete city days we've shared.

### Modern Spaces

- **[Little Island]({{ '/articles/island' | relative_url }})**  
  *Location:* Pier 55, Hudson River Park  
  *Known for:* Sunset skyline views, floating gardens  
  *Rating:* 7/10  
  Visited post-dessert, this outing was marked by soft light and soft conversation. A nostalgic return for me, and the kind of view that encourages you to pause, look around, and take stock of everything—and everyone—standing beside you.

## Notes

- Parks are typically visited after meals or on clear-weather afternoons and evenings.
- Selections are often spontaneous, but consistently well-suited to the moment.
- Scores reflect overall experience, not just amenities.
