# La Mercerie

La Mercerie is one of those places that makes you feel like you've stepped into a carefully curated Parisian dream. Tucked within the Roman and Williams Guild in SoHo, it's a space that blurs the line between a high-end furniture showroom and a sophisticated French café. The first time I visited, I actually circled the building twice, unsure if I was in the right place—a testament to how seamlessly the restaurant integrates with its surroundings.

## Atmosphere

The interior is nothing short of breathtaking. High ceilings create an airy, expansive feel, while lush plants add a touch of natural elegance to the space. The design is distinctly French, with plush aqua mohair banquettes and pale-gray floors that create a sophisticated yet inviting atmosphere. What's particularly interesting is how the space flows between the restaurant and the furniture showroom—there's no hard division, and diners can be found enjoying their meals among the carefully curated furniture pieces.

Claire and I chose to sit at the bar, which turned out to be an excellent decision. The service was prompt and attentive, and we had a perfect view of the restaurant's elegant interior. The bar itself is a work of art, with custom-designed "Angelica" dining tables and artisan glassware that adds to the overall aesthetic.

## The Food

We started with the buckwheat crêpe complète, a dish that's become something of a signature for La Mercerie. Filled with Paris-style ham, Comté cheese, and topped with a perfectly cooked sunny-side-up egg, it was a revelation in flavor combinations. The crème fraîche added a luxurious touch, creating a dish that balanced savory and sweet elements in a way I'd never experienced before. Each bite was a journey through different textures and flavors—the crisp edges of the crêpe giving way to the creamy egg and the salty ham.

The quiche was nothing short of spectacular. I'm not exaggerating when I say it was the best quiche I've ever had. The filling was incredibly soft and warm—almost too warm, as I learned when I took my first eager bite and nearly burned my tongue. But that initial heat was worth it for the perfect texture and flavor that followed. The crust was buttery and flaky, providing the ideal contrast to the rich, creamy filling.

## The Space

What sets La Mercerie apart is its unique integration with the Roman and Williams Guild. The space is divided into distinct areas, yet they flow together seamlessly. The front half of the building serves as a furniture showroom, while the back half houses the restaurant, but the transition between the two is so natural that it feels like one cohesive space. It's not uncommon to see diners enjoying their meals among the furniture displays, creating an atmosphere that's both sophisticated and relaxed.

The Guild Bar, an intimate space adjacent to the main dining area, offers bespoke cocktails served in beautiful artisan glassware. While we didn't sample the cocktails during our brunch visit, the bar's elegant design and the careful attention to detail in the glassware selection speaks to the overall commitment to quality and aesthetics.

## Final Thoughts

La Mercerie is more than just a restaurant—it's an experience that engages all the senses. From the moment you step through the door, you're enveloped in a world where design and gastronomy come together in perfect harmony. The food is exceptional, the atmosphere is sophisticated yet welcoming, and the attention to detail is evident in every aspect of the experience.

**Verdict:** 8.5/10  
A sophisticated French café that offers an exceptional dining experience in a beautifully designed space. The quiche alone is worth the visit, but the entire experience—from the elegant interior to the carefully crafted dishes—makes La Mercerie a destination worth seeking out in SoHo.
