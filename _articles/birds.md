# Birds of a Feather

Claire and I ended up at **Birds of a Feather** after walking through Brooklyn for a while. We checked out a few spots before landing here—I saw the interior through the window and was drawn in. I wasn’t totally sure if it would be any good, and I was nervous that Claire might not like it if it wasn’t authentic. Neither of us had been before, so it was a bit of a gamble.

## The Drinks

I ordered something called **The Raven**, which was basically an espresso martini with a twist—clove. It was one of those rare drinks that instantly triggers a memory. I hadn’t thought about clove in ages, but suddenly I was remembering baking with it as a kid. It was nostalgic and sharp in the best way.

## The Food

We shared two dishes: **Shredded Beef with Chili** and something intriguingly named **Curiously Tasty Chicken**.

The beef? Absolutely unreal. I thought the chilis on the menu photo were bell peppers, so I was caught off guard when they lit up my mouth—but in a good way. I kept sneaking bites long after I said I was full, right up until the waiter took the plate away. Rich, flavorful, and just spicy enough to keep it interesting.

The chicken dish surprised me even more. I’d never had **wintermelon** before, let alone in a savory dish. But it worked—like really worked. The sauce was cumin-heavy and tied everything together perfectly. Over rice, it was pure comfort.

## Atmosphere

I have to say—the design of this place was completely my style. Exposed brick walls, vintage lighting, a sleek bar in the back, and sunlight pouring in from a skylight above. It felt modern and warm at the same time. There’s this massive communal table that stretches down the center, but Claire and I got a smaller table off to the side, which was perfect. We could actually talk without shouting, and it felt kind of like our own little world inside the restaurant.

## Final Thoughts

Birds of a Feather totally won me over. The drinks, the food, the vibe—it all came together in a way that just worked. It felt like a proper find, the kind of place you want to bring people to and pretend you’ve known about forever.

**Verdict:** 9/10  
Stylish, spicy, and surprisingly nostalgic. I’d absolutely go back.
