# Little Island

After a visit to [Levain Bakery]({{ '/articles/levain' | relative_url }}), Claire and I decided to take a stroll to Little Island to cap off a really nice night in the city. It was one of those perfect New York evenings, where the weather was just right and the sunset made everything feel extra special. I had been to Little Island before, so I suggested it as a place to hang out. It’s one of those spots that never gets old, and I was eager to keep spending time with Claire and take in the views.

Little Island is a unique park, nestled right along the Hudson River, offering beautiful views of the skyline. It’s a place that holds a special spot in my heart, as it was the first place I went to the night I moved to New York. That evening felt like the start of something new, and visiting it again was a nostalgic experience. It was really interesting to see how much has changed since I first came here—like the Westin across the river, which used to have a red logo but now sports a blue one. Little Island feels like a reminder of how much I’ve experienced, and now, as I’m about to leave, it feels a little bittersweet.

We arrived at the park just in time for the sunset. The view of the city from Little Island is breathtaking. From there, you can see the entire skyline, stretching down towards the Financial District. It’s the kind of place where the city feels alive, yet peaceful at the same time. Watching the sunset over the water was a perfect moment to just be present with Claire, enjoying the calmness of the park after a fun night out.

As we wandered around, we stumbled upon some chimes in the park, and of course, we both had to give them a try. I attempted to make a song, but let’s just say, I couldn’t quite get the hang of it! We laughed it off, enjoying the simple fun of it all.

Little Island is definitely one of my favorite places to visit in the city, and it felt especially full-circle to return there. The park has a way of making you appreciate the beauty of New York from a different perspective. It’s a great place to relax and take in the view, and if you’re ever in the city, you should definitely visit, especially around sunset.

**Verdict:** 7/10  
It’s a beautiful spot, perfect for an evening out, and I’m glad I could share it with Claire before I leave.
