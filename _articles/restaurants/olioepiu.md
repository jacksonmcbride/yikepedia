# Olio e Più

Claire and I had been debating between a few spots for dinner when we finally settled on Olio e Più. Nestled in the heart of the West Village, this trattoria exudes a rustic charm that immediately transports you to the Italian countryside.

## Atmosphere

Stepping inside, we were greeted by warm wooden beams, vintage chandeliers, and an array of antique paintings adorning the walls. The ambiance reminded me of [Bakeri]({{ '/articles/bakeri.html' | relative_url }}), with its cozy, old-world European feel. Behind Claire hung a painting whose earthy tones perfectly complemented her brown eyes, making them stand out even more.

Anticipating rain, we opted for indoor seating. In hindsight, the weather held up, and the outdoor patio, adorned with lush greenery and twinkling lights, would have been equally delightful. Our waiter, a polite European gentleman, seemed perpetually in motion, attending to guests with a brisk efficiency that added to the lively atmosphere.

## The Food

We began our meal with the **Carpaccio di Polipo**, a delicate octopus carpaccio drizzled with a zesty tartar sauce. The thinly sliced calamari melted in our mouths, and the sauce was so flavorful I could have eaten it by the spoonful.

For our main courses, Claire chose the **salmon**, while I couldn't resist the **Spaghetti alla Carbonara**. The carbonara was a nostalgic dish for me, reminiscent of the ones my nanny used to make during my childhood. The pasta was perfectly al dente, coated in a rich, cheesy sauce, and topped with a golden egg yolk that added a luxurious creaminess.

Claire's salmon was equally impressive—flaky, juicy, and accompanied by roasted carrots and other seasonal vegetables that complemented the fish beautifully.

## Final Thoughts

We lingered at our table long after our plates were cleared, savoring the ambiance and each other's company. Olio e Più is more than just a restaurant; it's an experience—a place where time slows down, and every detail, from the decor to the dishes, is thoughtfully curated.

**Verdict:** 9.5/10  
An enchanting spot for a memorable dinner. We'll definitely be returning.
