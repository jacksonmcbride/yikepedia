# Madame Vo

Some meals are carefully planned. Others just *happen*. Our trip to Madame Vo definitely fell into the second category. After visiting [Schmucks]({{ '/articles/schmucks.html' | relative_url }}) with Claire, we were still a little hungry, and Madame Vo happened to pop up on the map just a few blocks away. Claire didn’t even hesitate—*“We have to go,”* she said. And thank God she did.

## The Food

Claire knew the menu like it was a playlist she’d memorized. She immediately ordered the **Beef Pho** and the **Tet Noodles**, and let me just say—her instincts were flawless.

Let’s start with the Tet Noodles. Imagine the best parts of a Vietnamese dish and the soul of a creamy Italian pasta, and you’ve got a bowl of these noodles. The sauce was rich and velvety—almost like a spicy carbonara, but with a bright, herbal edge. The prawns were cooked perfectly: plump, a little sweet, and just firm enough to carry the heat. I’m not exaggerating when I say I thought about this dish for *days*. It was that good.

Now, the Beef Pho. On any other night, this would have been the star. The broth was deeply aromatic—hours of simmering you could taste in every spoonful. The beef itself? Fall-off-the-bone tender, melt-in-your-mouth perfection. Each component—noodles, herbs, onions—felt thoughtfully balanced. It was comfort food turned elevated cuisine, and somehow still exactly what you’d want on a cold night out.

## Atmosphere

The restaurant has a sleek, modern vibe with a bit of that polished East Village cool. Despite the buzz of a packed house, our bar seats felt strangely secluded—like we were in our own little world. That ended up being perfect, because Claire and I were deep in conversation the entire time. It was nice to talk about a bunch of random subjects, from fireflies to factor models.

We talked for so long that the bar eventually started closing down around us. But it never felt rushed, and I think that they actually let us stay a while after they closed. It was a great mal. 

## Final Thoughts

Madame Vo's is one of those places you just have to try. I am not going to lie, I was a bit concerned that it would not live up to the hype that Claire was giving it. But admittedly, it was pretty amazing. If for nothing else, you need to try Madame Vo's Tet noodles. They are unlike anything that you have ever tried before. 

**Verdict:** 9/10  
Would return in a heartbeat. Possibly just for the Tet Noodles.
