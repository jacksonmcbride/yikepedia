# Schmucks

Schmucks is the kind of bar that feels like it was genetically engineered —and I say that with full admiration. I came across its sleek interior and exterior on Tik Tok, and decided that it was somewhere I needed to try out. 

We *should* have known what we were walking into. TikTok bar? On a Friday night? Yeah. It was **packed**. We couldn’t get a seat in the main room, so we ended up in the standing area—basically a narrow wall counter that felt like the bar equivalent of a waiting room at a cool dentist’s office.

We hovered there for a while, clutching the ledge like it was a lifeboat. Eventually, a group left and we snagged seats, finally settling into the experience.

## The Drinks

To say the cocktails were “unique” is underselling it. These were **experiments** in the best way—sweet, unusual, and completely unfamiliar. I couldn’t really compare them to anything else I’ve tried. They were entirely doing their own thing, with bold confidence. Im a geek for glassware, and their stuff was fire. Despite the fact that the glasses were simple, they were pretty unique, and each drink was served on a paper coaster that matched the aesthetic. Definitely an experience—not a go-to cocktail, but something you remember.

## The Space

This is where Schmucks really shines. The design is out of this world—literally. There’s a **disco ball**, weird shiny curvy panels on the ceiling, and a layout that’s as quirky as the cocktails. It’s *tiny*, but it leans into the smallness. I found myself wondering what this space used to be—maybe a garage? Whatever it was, Schmucks preserved that scrappy, industrial soul. It reminded me quite a bit of the Eastern Eurpoean Brutalism that I saw so much as as kid at all the fencing competitions.

The walls are bare, the lighting is soft-but-strange, and everything feels curated but not overproduced. It has that rare quality of feeling retro *and* futuristic, like if the ‘80s never ended and just kept getting weirder in a baller way.

## The Crowd

Cool. Loud. Everywhere. These people were chiccccc. It felt like I was getting fashion-mogged by just about everyone there. 

It’s hard to ignore how many people are stuffed into this place. They’re all dressed well, radiating with "I have some cool stories" energy, but the volume level means you’ll be raising your voice just to order. And yes, there was a line outside. So, plan accordingly—or go off-hours if you want to *actually* sit and savor the vibes.

## Final Thoughts

Schmucks is bold, unapologetically weird, and totally in rigth now. The cocktails are strange in a fun way, and the space is one of the most memorable I’ve seen in a while. That said, the crowd and volume can definitely test your patience. It’s not the bar you go to for quiet conversation—but if you want a sensory overload with style, Schmucks delivers.

**Verdict:** 7.5/10  
Would go again, but preferably not during TikTok prime time.
