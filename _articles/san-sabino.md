# San Sabino

I've been eyeing San Sabino for a while now, and I can't wait to take Claire here. It's the latest creation from the brilliant minds behind Don Angie—chefs Angie Rito and Scott Tacinelli—and it promises to be everything we love about dining in the West Village: intimate, inventive, and full of personality.

## The Concept

What makes San Sabino special is its unique take on coastal Italian-American cuisine. It's not just another Italian restaurant—it's a love letter to Tacinelli's grandfather from Sanza, Italy, reimagined through the lens of American coastal cities. The menu reads like a culinary road trip, drawing inspiration from New Orleans' bold flavors, San Francisco's seafood traditions, and even the Jersey Shore's casual charm.

## The Space

The restaurant's design is a masterclass in retro-chic. Picture a 1970s Malibu diner, but make it sophisticated. The butter-yellow walls create a warm, inviting atmosphere, while the curved bar serves as the perfect centerpiece. With only 55 seats, it's intimate without feeling cramped—exactly the kind of place where Claire and I can enjoy a memorable evening together.

## The Menu

The menu is where San Sabino really shines. I'm particularly excited about the **shrimp parmesan**—imagine the classic comfort food, but elevated to new heights. The **lobster triangoli** sounds like the perfect dish to share, and I can't wait to see Claire's reaction to the **crab and mortadella dip** served with Ritz crackers. It's the kind of playful, nostalgic touch that makes a meal memorable.

## The Drinks

The cocktail program is just as creative as the food. The **garlic bread martini** has been getting a lot of buzz, and I can already picture Claire's delighted surprise when she tries it. It's exactly the kind of inventive twist that makes a night out special.

## Why We'll Love It

I can see us here on a warm evening, sharing plates of seafood, sipping creative cocktails, and enjoying the surf-rock ambiance. The intimate setting, combined with the playful menu and warm service, makes it the perfect spot for a date night. I know Claire will appreciate the thoughtful details—from the retro-chic decor to the inventive takes on classic dishes.

## Final Thoughts

San Sabino represents everything I love about New York's dining scene: creativity, personality, and a sense of place. I can't wait to experience it with Claire, to see her reaction to the garlic bread martini, to share the lobster triangoli, and to create new memories in this vibrant space.

**Verdict:** TBD (But I have a feeling it's going to be amazing)  
A perfect blend of nostalgia and innovation, waiting for us to discover together.
