# Pylos

Claire and I found ourselves in the East Village this past weekend, and Pylos caught our eye. I didn’t know what to expect walking in, but the first thing that hit me was the ceiling—**hundreds of terracotta Greek pots** suspended above us like an art installation. It was unlike anything I’ve seen at a restaurant before—an architectural gesture that felt both traditional and theatrical.

## Atmosphere

We got lucky with our table—just the right distance from the door, which stayed open the entire time. The soft spring air drifted in, mixing with the warm chatter of the dining room and the faint clink of glasses. It made the whole dinner feel almost Mediterranean. Claire looked especially pretty in the golden-hour light filtering through the entryway.

## The Food

To start, we ordered a spread of dips and pita. The **tzatziki** stood out immediately—firmer than most, almost structured, like it was holding itself together with pride. It was refreshing and bright. We also got the **taramosalata**, a lemony fish roe dip that delivered a tangy punch, and **melitzanosalata**, a smoky eggplant purée laced with extra-virgin olive oil. Both played beautifully with the warm pita—every bite layered with texture and flavor.

For our mains, we decided to split two dishes. First, the **moussaka**: layers of sautéed eggplant, zucchini, and potato baked with aromatic meat sauce and topped with creamy béchamel in a clay dish. It felt almost like eating a family recipe passed down generations.

But the **brizola**—a 16 oz aged prime New York strip steak—**stole the show**. It came with golden fried potatoes and some of the best sautéed spinach I’ve had in a while. The meat was cooked just right, crusted on the outside and tender in the middle, with a hint of smoky char.

## Final Thoughts

Everything at Pylos feels a little elevated—not just the food, but the atmosphere too. It strikes a balance between elegance and comfort, like a well-kept secret you stumble into by accident. I’ll definitely remember the ceiling, the open door, and that steak.

**Verdict:** 8/10  
A stylish and memorable Greek spot perfect for a breezy spring night out.
