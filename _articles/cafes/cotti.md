# Cotti Coffee

**Cotti Coffee** is one of Claire's favorite coffee spots—a rapidly growing coffee chain that's disrupting the market with its ultra-affordable pricing and innovative drink menu. Founded in 2022 by former Luckin Coffee executives, Cotti has quickly expanded to over 10,000 stores worldwide, offering quality coffee at accessible prices.

What makes Cotti special isn't just the coffee, though. It's the sweet gesture that Claire made one day when she surprised me at work with drinks from Cotti. No one had ever done something like that for me before, and it meant the world.

## The Surprise

Claire showed up at my office with two drinks from Cotti—an **americano with grapefruit juice** for me and a **jasmine tea latte** for herself. The americano was absolutely perfect—strong, smooth, and the grapefruit juice added this bright, refreshing twist that I'd never had before. It powered me through the rest of my workday like nothing else could.

The fact that she thought to bring me coffee at work, that she knew exactly what I'd like, and that she went out of her way to surprise me—it was one of those small moments that just makes you realize how lucky you are to have someone like that in your life.

## The Concept & Experience

Cotti Coffee operates on an ultra-low-price strategy, with most drinks priced around ¥9.9 (about $1.40), making quality coffee accessible to everyone. They've mastered the art of the quick, convenient coffee experience with their "Express" small-format pickup shops and kiosks embedded in convenience stores and retailers.

The chain has been incredibly innovative, introducing 119 new beverage varieties in 2024 alone, including fruit-infused drinks and novelty lattes. Their menu constantly evolves to keep things fresh and competitive, which explains why Claire keeps coming back.

## The Drinks

My americano with grapefruit juice was a revelation—the perfect balance of strong coffee and citrus brightness. It's exactly the kind of innovative drink that sets Cotti apart from traditional coffee chains. Claire's jasmine tea latte looked equally impressive, with that delicate floral note that makes it feel like a treat rather than just another coffee.

The quality is consistently good, especially considering the price point. It's the kind of place where you can experiment with new flavors without breaking the bank, which is probably why Claire loves it so much.

## Final Thoughts

Cotti Coffee represents the future of coffee culture—accessible, innovative, and convenient. But beyond the business model and the drinks, what I'll remember most is Claire's thoughtful surprise. Sometimes the best coffee isn't just about the taste—it's about who you're sharing it with and the moments that make you smile.

**Verdict:** 8.5/10  
Excellent coffee, innovative drinks, and the sweetest surprise from Claire.
