# Amorino Gelato

Our trip to [Central Park]({{ '/articles/centralpark' | relative_url }}) had already been near-perfect: boats, bikes, brownstones. But Claire, in classic Claire fashion, had another xace up her sleeve. 

As we were leaving [Central Park]({{ '/articles/centralpark' | relative_url }}), Claire mentioned that she knew a place for gelato nearby. There was something quietly confident about the way she said it—like she’d been saving this idea for the perfect moment. A few blocks later, we were walking through the doors of Amorino Gelato. It wasn’t just a good call—it was one of those unexpectedly perfect additions to the day. Turns out, when Claire says she knows a spot, you listen.

## The Experience

Walking into Amorino felt like entering a tiny pocket of Europe tucked into the Village. A crowd had already formed, buzzing with anticipation and that low-key excitement only dessert places ever seem to create. It was packed, which—as I’ve learned from being around Claire—usually means you’re in for something great. She’s got a radar for these things.

She also has a radar for *me*, because she pointed me straight toward the **Pistachio flavor**—rich, earthy, just the right amount of sweet. She suggested this even before we walked in the door. And she was right. I took her advice a step further and added the **pistachio drizzle** on top. Game-changer. The drizzle turned it into something even more decadent—like the flavor had leveled up mid-bite.

The signature Amorino cone is shaped like a flower, and when it arrived in my hand, I had to pause. It was genuinely beautiful. Claire’s was somehow even prettier—pastel petals in perfect symmetry. I told her it looked like art, and she kind of laughed it off, but I meant it.

There’s something kind of charming about watching someone eat something they love. Claire didn’t say much while she was eating her cone—just a few quiet “mm”s and an approving nod—but it was all there. I think she was happy. I definitely was.

## The Walk Back

We wandered slowly, cones in hand, letting the afternoon stretch out just a little longer. It wasn’t just about the gelato anymore. It was about the way we paused to look at the brownstones—the way we noticed little things, like how one was painted this almost obnoxiously bright green while the rest were all quiet brick.

That one green house somehow became a metaphor in my head. Like, in a row of sameness, it didn’t ask for attention—but it got it anyway. Kind of like how this day snuck up on me and turned out to be something I’d remember.

On the way back, Claire suggested we stop at Nuts Factory A little salty to balance out the sweet—it felt like she knew exactly how to round out the day. At this point, it was starting to feel like we were building something of a shared rhythm: Claire and Jax, wandering snack critics. I finally got to try the Dubai Chocolate, which I’d heard about but had never actually tasted. I wasn’t expecting the crunch, but it totally caught me off guard—in the best way.

## Final Thoughts

Amorino is more than just good gelato—it’s an experience. The flower cones are whimsical, yes, but they’re also crafted with a level of detail that feels oddly intimate. And maybe that’s what made it so memorable.

There was no rush. No big declaration. Just gelato, a slow walk, and someone who somehow always seems to know what I’m in the mood for—before I do.

**Verdict:** 7.5/10  
Definitely going back—more flavors to try, more moments to make.
