# Bakeri

The first thing that hits you about **Bakeri** is the exterior—it looks like something out of a storybook. There’s this charming wooden door framed by the brick skeleton of the building, the kind of place that feels like it’s been there forever. Which is why I was shocked to learn they only opened in 2009. There's a timeless, almost French aura to it.

## The Vibe

Step inside and you're met with warmth—literally and figuratively. The interior is all wood, soft lighting, and an open kitchen that makes it feel more like someone's home than a business. You can see the bakers moving through the space, some of them even stopping to help customers like it’s the most natural thing in the world.

One of the bakers actually helped me figure out what to order. I ended up with this rich chocolate dessert—still not sure what it was called—but it had a crisp, flaky shell and a center that was pure, intense chocolate. It was decadent without being overwhelming. A quiet little masterpiece.

## The Real Star

Claire came prepared. She’d done her research and knew Bakeri was famous for their **cinnamon rolls**, and—no surprise—she was right. These cinnamon rolls were incredible. Warm, gooey, soft in the center with that slight caramelized crunch on the edges. They reminded me of the kind I used to get after Sunday school at the little church near where I grew up. It was nostalgic and comforting in a way I didn’t expect.

## Final Thoughts

Bakeri isn’t flashy. It doesn’t try too hard. It just *is*—in the best way. There’s something very genuine about the whole experience, like you’re stepping into someone’s quiet routine. Between the cozy atmosphere, helpful staff, and unforgettable pastries, I’m really glad we made the trip.

**Verdict:** 8.75/10  
Old-world charm with pastries to match. Would absolutely go again—especially for the cinnamon rolls.
