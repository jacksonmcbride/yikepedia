# ENLY Café

ENLY is one of those places that makes you feel like you've discovered a hidden gem in the heart of Nolita. Founded by model and entrepreneur Enly Tammela, this boutique café and candle studio combines Nordic and Japanese influences to create a unique space that's as much about the experience as it is about the coffee. Claire's enthusiasm for the place was evident when she told me she had visited twice in consecutive days—a testament to its charm.

## Atmosphere

The space is intimate and thoughtfully designed, with a warm, inviting atmosphere that draws you in. When we visited after our brunch at [La Mercerie]({{ '/articles/la-mercerie' | relative_url }}), the café was quite crowded, but the energy was vibrant and welcoming. What sets ENLY apart is its dual identity as both a café and a candle studio. As we waited in line, we took the opportunity to explore the various candles on display, each with its own unique scent profile.

I was particularly drawn to their jasmine candle, which had a delicate, intoxicating aroma. The space also features an in-store workshop where patrons can observe or even participate in candle-making sessions, adding an interactive element to the experience. The candles are housed in custom vessels created by Brooklyn artist William Couig, making them as much a visual delight as they are a sensory one.

## The Drinks

The menu at ENLY is a carefully curated selection of specialty drinks that blend traditional coffee culture with innovative flavors. Claire opted for the viral tiramisu latte, which lived up to its reputation. The drink was sweet and indulgent, with a perfect balance of coffee and dessert-like flavors that made it feel like a treat rather than just a caffeine fix.

I chose the banana cream cold brew, though I have to admit, Claire's tiramisu latte was the better choice. The cold brew was good, but the tiramisu latte had that special something that made it memorable. The café uses Devoción coffee and ceremonial-grade matcha, ensuring that even their most creative drinks maintain a high standard of quality.

## The Experience

While our visit was brief, it was clear why ENLY has developed such a loyal following. The combination of specialty coffee, artisanal candles, and the unique workshop space creates an experience that's more than just a coffee shop. It's a place where you can enjoy a carefully crafted drink while immersing yourself in the art of candle-making.

The café's menu also includes small bites like avocado toast on Estonian black rye and Eleven Madison Park granola with coconut yogurt and honey, though we didn't have the chance to try these during our visit. The space is open Monday through Saturday from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM, and Sunday from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM, making it a perfect spot for both morning coffee runs and afternoon pick-me-ups.

## Final Thoughts

ENLY is the kind of place that makes you want to return, even if your first visit is brief. The combination of specialty coffee, artisanal candles, and the unique workshop space creates an experience that's both relaxing and engaging. It's a place where you can enjoy a carefully crafted drink while immersing yourself in the art of candle-making.

**Verdict:** 8/10  
A charming café that offers more than just coffee. The tiramisu latte is a must-try, and the candle-making workshop adds a unique dimension to the experience. While it can get crowded, the atmosphere and quality of the drinks make it worth the visit.
