# Van Leeuwen

After our wonderful dinner at [Pylos]({{ '/articles/pylos' | relative_url }}), Claire and I decided to cap off the evening with some ice cream at Van Leeuwen. The East Village location was perfectly situated for our post-dinner stroll, and what followed was an evening filled with unique flavors, heartfelt moments, and a special letter that made the experience truly memorable.

## The Ice Cream

I went with the **Earl Grey Tea** ice cream, which was unlike any ice cream I'd ever tasted. The subtle bergamot notes and tea flavor created a sophisticated, almost perfumed taste that I found absolutely delightful. Claire, however, had a different take—she mentioned it reminded her of soap, which made us both laugh. She chose a combination of **Banana and Peanut Butter**, and I have to say, both flavors were exceptional. The banana flavor was particularly remarkable—it tasted like the essence of a perfectly ripe banana, not artificial at all.

## The Experience

What made this visit special wasn't just the ice cream, though. We found a quiet spot on some steps in front of a nearby house, where we could enjoy our treats and each other's company. The evening air was perfect for ice cream, and the conversation flowed naturally.

Claire had brought something special—a letter she had written while in the Catskills. The envelope was adorned with a beautifully drawn deer, showcasing her artistic talent. It was a thoughtful gesture that added another layer of meaning to our evening.

I have to admit, I had a moment where I tried to kiss her, which ended up being a bit awkward. But Claire, being the amazing person she is, handled it with such grace that the moment passed without any lingering discomfort. It's moments like these that remind me how lucky I am to have someone who can turn potentially awkward situations into opportunities for connection.

## Final Thoughts

Van Leeuwen delivered an ice cream experience that went beyond just dessert. The unique flavors, the intimate setting, and the personal touches—from Claire's letter to our shared moments on those steps—made it a night to remember.

**Verdict:** 8/10  
A perfect spot for post-dinner treats, especially when paired with good company and heartfelt moments.
