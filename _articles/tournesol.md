# Tournesol

Tournesol is one of those places that makes you feel like you've stumbled into a hidden corner of Paris, right in the heart of Long Island City. From the moment we walked in, the warm glow of the red banquettes and the white tin ceilings created an atmosphere that was both intimate and inviting. It's the kind of place where you can't help but feel like you're in on a secret—a little slice of France that somehow found its way to Queens.

## Atmosphere

The restaurant's charm is undeniable. The single-room layout creates an intimate setting, with local artwork adorning the walls and a vintage car parked out front that serves as both advertisement and conversation piece. When we arrived, the place was quiet, but as our meal progressed, a steady stream of diners began to fill the space, creating a gentle buzz of conversation and clinking glasses.

Our waiter, a cool and hip older gentleman with a man bun, added to the experience. Claire couldn't help but notice his resemblance to Gappy, her legendary boss, which added a touch of familiarity to the evening. His knowledge of the menu and attentive service made us feel right at home.

## The Food

We started with the escargot, and I have to say, it was a revelation. The snails were perfectly cooked, swimming in a rich, buttery sauce that was elevated by the addition of crispy breadcrumbs. It was a dish that made me understand why people get so excited about French cuisine—every bite was a perfect balance of texture and flavor.

For our main courses, we decided to split two dishes: the duck breast and the hangar steak. The duck was nothing short of spectacular. I don't typically order duck, but this dish changed my perspective entirely. The meat was perfectly cooked, with a crispy skin that gave way to tender, flavorful flesh. It came with creamy mashed potatoes and a sweet grape sauce that tied everything together beautifully. Each component complemented the others, creating a dish that was greater than the sum of its parts.

The hangar steak was equally impressive. Cooked to perfection, it was accompanied by a generous portion of French fries. Claire made an interesting observation about how every restaurant puts their own spin on fries, and Tournesol's version was particularly noteworthy—crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and seasoned just right.

## Dessert

We finished our meal with a coconut chocolate dessert that was the perfect ending to our French feast. The combination of coconut and chocolate was a match made in heaven—I was particularly taken with the coconut elements, while Claire favored the chocolate components. It was a dessert that managed to be both rich and refreshing, a fitting conclusion to our meal.

## Final Thoughts

Tournesol is the kind of restaurant that makes you want to return before you've even left. The combination of authentic French cuisine, warm atmosphere, and attentive service creates an experience that feels both special and accessible. It's a place where you can enjoy a romantic dinner or a casual meal with friends, and either way, you'll leave feeling like you've discovered something wonderful.

**Verdict:** 8.75/10  
A hidden gem in Long Island City that delivers an authentic French dining experience. The duck alone is worth the visit, but the entire meal is a journey through classic French cuisine at its best.
