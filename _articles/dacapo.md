# Da Capo

**Da Capo** is a dual-purpose café and bar on the Upper West Side that blends old-world espresso culture with modern cocktail sensibilities. By day, it functions as a sleek espresso bar with a selection of classic coffee offerings and Italian pastries. By night, it shifts into an atmospheric cocktail bar and restaurant, complete with a full dinner menu and a rotating lineup of creative drinks.

I visited Da Capo with a friend, and though it wasn’t planned around anything in particular, it turned out to be a great spot to just hang out and talk. The interior has an industrial-modern aesthetic, with warm lighting, clean lines, and a relaxed tone that doesn’t feel forced.

## The Back Room

One of the more unique features of Da Capo is the back room—an enclosed seating area tucked behind the main café. The ceiling is partially translucent, letting in a soft natural light that makes the space feel open without being exposed. It’s easy to imagine how great it would be on a summer afternoon with the sunlight pouring in.

It’s quiet, low-key, and feels like a little retreat from the pace of the city. Perfect for catching up, reading, or just sipping something slowly.

## Why Claire Should Go

It’s not necessarily the kind of place you’d find on a trending café list, but that’s part of the appeal. Da Capo isn’t trying to be flashy—it’s just doing everything *well*. Great drinks, good design, and a space that feels considered. The kind of place that doesn’t need to be loud to be memorable.

Claire would love the balance of function and atmosphere here—especially the back room, which has that plant-lit serenity she tends to gravitate toward.

**Verdict:** One of the better Upper West Side surprises. Definitely worth a summer return.
