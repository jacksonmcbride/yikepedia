# Drumsticks, Brussels Sprouts, and Shrimp (04/18/2025)

After spending the afternoon in [Central Park]({{ '/articles/centralpark' | relative_url }}) and stopping by [Amorino Gelato]({{ '/articles/amorino-gelato' | relative_url }}), the day didn’t just end—it leveled up. Claire invited me over for a home-cooked meal, and to say it exceeded expectations would be an understatement.

It’s one thing to enjoy the places Claire picks—her taste is consistently exceptional—but it’s another thing entirely to experience that same instinct for flavor and balance in her own kitchen. This dinner made it clear: Claire doesn’t just know food—she *creates* it.

## The Brussels Sprouts

These deserve to be talked about first.

Growing up, my dad set the standard for Brussels sprouts—sautéed with butter, garlic, and a medley of flavors that made them a staple in my childhood. So, I’ll admit it: I quietly had a high bar going in, and I may have been internally preparing to smile politely at something just okay.

But no.

Claire’s Brussels sprouts were buttery, golden, and perfectly cooked—tender but with just enough bite. Whatever combination of spices she used elevated them into a league of their own. I remember scanning her spice rack when she wasn’t looking, trying to reverse engineer the flavor. No luck. Claire, if you’re reading this—please send me the recipe. For science.

## The Shrimp and Rice

The aroma alone set the tone for the shrimp: rich, spiced, slightly smoky. It was the kind of smell that makes you hungrier *after* you start eating. The texture was spot-on—firm but juicy—and it paired beautifully with the rice, which had black beans folded in for added depth.

I may or may not have eaten more than my fair share of the shrimp. That’s a testament to the dish—not a lack of self-control (probably).

The rice was subtle but smart. Every forkful had dimension, and it served as the perfect base to let the other flavors shine without ever feeling like an afterthought.

## The Drumsticks

Claire first mentioned the drumsticks earlier in the day, and it was clear they were a centerpiece dish. They ended up being even better than expected.

Spiced just enough to keep you guessing, with a low heat that built gradually, the drumsticks were incredibly tender—fall-off-the-bone level. The outside had a slight crisp that gave way to juicy, flavorful meat underneath. Whatever technique she used worked, and it left a serious impression.

## Final Thoughts

There’s something quietly powerful about someone cooking for you—especially when it’s this thoughtful, this flavorful, and this clearly made with care. Claire’s dinner was more than just good food—it was an experience. It felt generous, intuitive, and quietly impressive in all the best ways.

**Verdict:** 9.5/10  
Would gladly eat this every week for the rest of time.
