# Levy Gorvy Dayan

Some places speak softly, and some whisper directly into your soul. Levy Gorvy Dayan did the latter. Claire and I wandered in almost by accident, but what we found inside became one of the most memorable art experiences I’ve had in New York.

## The Exhibit

We visited on the last day of a solo exhibition—an artist who worked almost entirely with **mirrors** and **QR codes**, blending digital and physical space in a way that was as playful as it was thought-provoking. Each room had a kind of dare built into it: *Will you peek behind the curtain? Will you lift the log and break the glass?*

It wasn’t just art—it was **invitation**. And strangely, despite the sense of curiosity and almost mischievous provocation, everything was carefully structured. There was an organization to the experience that’s rare in contemporary galleries. It felt like the artist had laid out a series of puzzles or games, but never forced your hand. You *wanted* to play along.

## The Vibe

One of the most striking things? We were almost completely alone. Room after room, it was just Claire and me, speaking softly like we were in on a secret. That privacy added something profound—it felt like the exhibit was ours, just for that afternoon.

The studio itself was beautiful. The **floor tiles** alone were worth admiring—geometric, elegant, and quietly mesmerizing. It had that gallery stillness that makes you feel like time is moving differently, and for a while, I forgot we were in the middle of Manhattan.

Oh, and I nearly knocked over a full-length mirror while trying to take a closer look at one of the installations. So... there's that.

## Bonus Footnote

I actually picked up some brochures and materials from the gallery but—of course—left them at [Angel's Share]({{ '/articles/share.html' | relative_url }}). A fitting place for forgotten treasures.

## Final Thoughts

Levy Gorvy Dayan was an unexpected favorite. I’ve been to a lot of art spaces in the city, but few have felt this **personal**. The interactivity, the solitude, the subtle challenges woven into each piece—it all made for a perfect afternoon with Claire.

**Verdict:** 9/10  
Would go back in a heartbeat. Especially if there’s a mirror I haven’t almost broken yet.
