# Ruby's Cafe

Ruby’s Cafe is a popular Australian-style brunch spot nestled in the heart of Nolita, Manhattan, known for its bustling vibe, chic crowd, and the now-legendary Bronte Burger. The restaurant manages to strike a delicate balance between laid-back coastal charm and New York City hustle—think Bondi Beach meets SoHo sidewalk.

The journey to Ruby’s began, fittingly, with a recommendation from Claire, a trusted culinary informant with a flawless track record. Eager to experience what all the fuss was about, I went with a few friends from high school. Our adventure started with minor confusion—we could only find “Little Ruby’s,” which, to the untrained eye, appears to be a spinoff, a remix, or perhaps Ruby’s in disguise. (Spoiler: it’s the same place.)

Despite some light rain and a short wait (classic NYC brunch ritual), we eventually made it inside. It was packed to the brim, a sea of beanies, oat milk lattes, and people who look like they’ve definitely been to Australia “just for a month or two.” And yet, it felt welcoming.

## Bronte Burger

Let’s talk about the main event. The Bronte Burger. Going in, I assumed I was ordering something relatively straightforward: patty, bun, probably some aioli. What I got instead was a revelation.

The patty had the texture of a pan-seared meatball—juicy, rich, and surprisingly delicate. Even though I had foolishly eaten a full breakfast earlier in the day (rookie mistake), I found myself inhaling the entire thing. No regrets. Claire’s recommendation? Spot on. 

## Dining Companions & Vibes

Beyond the food, the company made the outing memorable. One friend, currently planning a fencing-themed fashion show floated the idea of recruiting Columbia fencers for the runway. Another shared that she’s considering quitting her job and moving home, or going to San Fransisco and trying a career in tech. 

There’s something about Ruby’s that invites honesty. Maybe it’s the casual lighting, maybe it’s the $20 burgers. Either way, it felt like a meal worth remembering.

The interior of Ruby’s is compact and consequently it was pretty packed when we went. I hadn’t realized it was an Aussie cafe until someone pointed it out—at which point the flat whites, beachy branding, and casual charm all snapped into place like puzzle pieces.

## Verdict

The food is pretty amazing, the company fun, and the atmosphere lively without being overwhelming. Come for the Bronte Burger. Stay for the vibes, the surprising comfort of a meatball-textured patty, and maybe a little gossip over cold brew.

**Rating:** 7/10, would go again
