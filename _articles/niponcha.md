# Nippon Cha

We only stopped by **Nippon Cha** briefly, but it made an impression. Claire really recommended the place for matcha, so we decided to swing by while we were nearby.

## The Vibe

The first thing you notice when you walk in is the smell—fresh matcha being whisked and steamed behind the counter. It’s subtle, but unmistakable. It gives the whole place a kind of focused calm, like something ceremonial is always happening.

## The Drink

If I remember right, I got the **brown sugar matcha latte**. I was expecting it to be overly sweet, but it wasn’t at all. The sweetness was balanced, and the matcha itself was surprisingly strong—sharp, even, in some sips. You could tell they were serious about it.

What really stood out was the level of care. I noticed the baristas weighing out the matcha powder for each drink, making sure it was exact. That kind of precision feels rare in a casual café, and it made the whole experience feel more intentional.

## Final Thoughts

We didn’t stay long, and I’m not sure it’s the kind of place I’d rush back to without a craving, but for a quick, well-crafted matcha fix—it definitely delivered.

**Verdict:** 6.5/10  
Serious matcha for serious matcha people. Worth a stop if you’re in the area.
