# Effy's Cafe

Effy’s Cafe is a cozy Israeli-American brunch spot tucked into a quieter stretch of the Upper East Side, offering a warm, no-frills dining experience with plenty of character. Despite the name, Effy’s feels less like a quick-stop café and more like the kind of lowkey neighborhood restaurant where locals linger over bagel sandwiches and bottomless stories.

I stopped by with my best friend, Jaden, just as winter break was ending and campus still felt like a ghost town. We were expecting a simple coffee shop. What we found instead was something much more comforting—and a bit unexpected.

## Atmosphere

From the outside, Effy’s feels like a scene out of a '90s sitcom—the hand-painted, curly-letter signage, soft glow of warm lights, and a streetscape that’s quiet enough to hear your thoughts. It’s the kind of storefront that invites curiosity and promises coziness.

Inside, the café felt lived-in and personal. There were only a few people there, and the space had this family-run energy—warm, casual, and totally unpretentious. The decor was charming, with subtle nods to its Israeli roots and a welcoming vibe that made us feel like regulars even though it was our first time through the door.

## The Food

Let’s cut to the chase: **the food was exceptional.**

I ordered a bagel sandwich loaded with smoked salmon lox, grilled vegetables, and cream cheese. Now, I’ve eaten a lot of bagels in this city—but this one stood out. The flavors were bold but balanced, and the texture was spot-on. Cream cheese, often treated like a condiment, stepped into the spotlight here and tied everything together with rich, creamy authority. The sandwich was wrapped with just enough care to keep things neat without sacrificing the generous filling.

I paired it with a lemon and prawn salad, which honestly might’ve stolen the show. Light, citrusy, and beautifully fresh, it added a perfect contrast to the richness of the sandwich. It was one of those moments where you accidentally order the best thing on the menu.

## Company & Experience

More than just a great meal, it was a great hang. Jaden and I hadn’t seen each other since break, so we took our time catching up, laughing way too loudly, and being generally unserious. The staff didn’t seem to mind—in fact, the waiter was super chill and kept the vibe light without hovering.

There’s a generosity to the space at Effy’s, not just in portion size, but in atmosphere. It’s the kind of place where you can eat well, laugh loudly, and lose track of time without ever feeling rushed.

## Final Thoughts

Effy’s Cafe is a hidden gem that quietly delivers on all fronts. From the thoughtful menu to the warm service, it’s the kind of place you discover once and remember fondly every time brunch rolls around. Whether you’re craving a top-tier bagel sandwich or just want somewhere cozy to reconnect with a friend, Effy’s is more than up to the task.

**Verdict:** 8.5/10  
Would happily go back—and bring more friends next time.
