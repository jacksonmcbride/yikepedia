# Remi43

Remi43 is part café, part flower shop, and entirely Claire-coded. She recommended it to me knowing how much I love interiors with plants—and Remi43 *delivers*. There are plants everywhere: hanging from the ceiling, tucked into corners, growing in the windows, even perched on the counter. It feels less like a coffee shop and more like a greenhouse that happens to serve lattes.

## The Lavender Latte

I ordered the **lavender latte**, which came out looking like a Pinterest post brought to life. It had this soft purple hue, a subtle latte art flourish, and a few sprigs of real lavender sprinkled on top for good measure. The taste? Genuinely impressive. You could actually *taste* the lavender, not in an artificial syrupy way, but in a fragrant, floral way that felt… peaceful.

At the very end, I accidentally bit into one of the lavender buds—which was surprisingly cool. It’s a strange experience, tasting something that smells exactly like a candle aisle, but I mean that in the best way. I happen to love lavender, so it worked for me.

I wanted to try the **rose latte** too, mostly out of curiosity, but didn’t get the chance.

## The One Catch

I was only there for maybe 15 minutes.

The space is beautiful, but **tiny**. And very popular. By the time I finished my drink, there was still nowhere to sit, so I gave up my spot and relocated to the Columbia Libraries to actually get some work done.

## Final Thoughts

Remi43 is visually stunning and creatively ambitious. The drinks are floral, the vibe is lush, and the aesthetic is unmatched. But unless you go at an off-hour or get very lucky, seating can be a real issue.

**Verdict:** 5/10  
Absolutely worth visiting—but maybe plan on taking your drink to-go.
