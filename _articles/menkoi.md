# Menkoi Sato

Some places just feel like they're going to be good from the moment you walk in. But with **Menkoi Sato**, I had that feeling before we even stepped inside.

Claire took me here after we spent the evening at [Angel's Share]({{ '/articles/share' | relative_url }}). As we walked toward the restaurant, she casually dropped the fact that **Taylor Swift’s “Cornelia Street”** was inspired by the very street we were on. That’s the kind of detail Claire always seems to know—random, poetic, and weirdly perfect.

## The Food

The place was packed, which is always a good sign. You could feel the heat and energy coming out of the open kitchen—literally. Every now and then, a flash of flames would light up the whole front of the restaurant. It was theatrical in the best way.

We sat at the end of a bench, side by side, just talking while we waited. Claire was adamant about the **fried chicken**, and I’m so glad she was. That stuff was on another level—crispy on the outside, juicy and tender inside. Easily one of the best bites of the night.

Then came the ramen. I got the **curry ramen**, which had a deep, warming flavor that hit hard without being overwhelming. Claire got a spicy bowl—*Tan Tan Men*, I think? Whatever it was, it was **incredible**. I kept reaching across the table to steal more bites than I should’ve, and Claire didn’t even stop me. That’s love, honestly.

## Atmosphere

Menkoi Sato has a raw, unfiltered energy to it. The kind of place that doesn’t try too hard because it doesn’t have to. It’s tight, busy, loud in a good way. Everyone’s there for the same reason: the food slaps.

We ended up staying for a while, just talking and soaking it in. Neither of us finished our bowls, which says more about the portion sizes than anything else. But it didn’t matter. The meal, the conversation, the vibe—it all just worked.

## Final Thoughts

Menkoi Sato feels like one of those rare spots where the energy of the room actually makes the food taste better. From the flames in the kitchen to the history on the street, everything added up to something bigger than just ramen.

**Verdict:** 8/10  
A must-visit. And next time, I’m ordering whatever Claire gets.
