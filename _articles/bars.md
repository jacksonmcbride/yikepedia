# Bars Visited

This page catalogs select bars visited across New York City, typically chosen for their ambiance, novelty, or proximity to something else we were already doing. Many of these outings were born from a spontaneous decision or a ‚Äúshould we just check it out?‚Äù moment‚Äîoften with Claire offering a quiet nudge in the right direction.

While some venues here are loud and chaotic (on purpose), others invite a slower kind of connection‚Äîlow-lit, wood-paneled, and ideal for letting conversations drift. Together, they form a list that‚Äôs curated less for the drinks themselves and more for the vibe they create.

## Overview

Bars included below range from theatrical cocktail dens to vintage-feeling hideaways. Each one brought something different to the table‚Äîsometimes literally‚Äîand the reviews reflect not just what was served, but what the night *felt* like.

## üç∏ Featured Bars

### [Schmucks]({{ '/articles/schmucks' | relative_url }})  
*Location:* 97 First Ave, East Village  
*Known for:* Maximalist cocktails, space-age interiors  
*Rating:* 7.5/10  
Equal parts circus and speakeasy, Schmucks is a chaotic delight‚Äîlike walking into a neon-lit fever dream with great music and even louder patrons. Claire and I were wedged in shoulder-to-shoulder at first, but once we found seats, it turned into an oddly unforgettable night of wild drinks and people-watching. Not ideal for deep talks, but unforgettable for sensory overload.

### [Angel‚Äôs Share]({{ '/articles/share' | relative_url }})  
*Location:* Secret (but you can probably find it)  
*Known for:* Discreet entrance, precise cocktails, jazz-adjacent ambiance  
*Rating:* 9/10  
Tucked away behind an unmarked door, Angel‚Äôs Share offered a sharp contrast to the noise of the city. Every cocktail felt handcrafted with intent. We sat in a cozy corner, surrounded by soft conversation and shadows. The kind of place where everything slows down‚Äîwhere time expands just enough to say exactly what you mean. Claire looked particularly at home here, which made the whole place feel even more like ours, somehow.

## Notes

- Bars are usually visited late in the evening or after dinner.
- Entries here focus as much on ambiance and conversation as on the cocktails themselves.
- ‚ÄúBest Time to Go‚Äù reflects ideal crowd conditions, not just operating hours.
