# Manjul

**Manjul** is a sleek, multi-concept café tucked into the Lower East Side—a place where minimalist interior design meets curated fashion retail. Claire and I checked it out just after winter break, not long after it first opened, which meant we beat a bit of the initial crowd (but not by much).

We picked it mostly for the vibe: super clean design, muted tones, and a giant tree planted right in the middle of the room. I figured it would be a perfect balance of the things Claire and I both love—stylish interiors, interesting drinks, and something a little bit new.

## The Experience

The space is beautiful. Everything from the polished concrete floors to the wood seating feels intentionally curated. There’s a centerpiece tree that anchors the room, and we managed to get seats right beside it. Even though it was already popular, the atmosphere didn’t feel rushed. Just… cool.

I ordered a **fizz** with a pineapple foam on top. Still not exactly sure what was in it, but it was delicious—light, slightly tart, and served in an elegant glass that made the whole thing feel elevated. I didn’t get to try the pastries, but they looked great behind the counter and definitely caught my attention.

Claire and I caught up on her trip to Japan, and she surprised me with two plushies she brought back—Bartholomuel and Coco (instant icons). We ended up spending a long time there, and toward the end, wandered into the back to check out the **fashion section** of the store. The clothing was experimental, made from fabric that felt kind of like my puffer jacket but more technical—and much more expensive.

Also, I think someone from my class might’ve been sitting next to us the entire time. I didn’t say anything because (a) it looked like she was on a date, and (b) I forgot her name.

## Final Thoughts

Manjul is effortlessly cool. It’s the kind of place where you can hang out for a while, sip something a little weird in a good way, and explore fashion pieces you definitely can’t afford. But despite its trendiness, it doesn’t feel try-hard. Just thoughtful.

**Verdict:** 8/10  
Great drinks, great design, and excellent company.
