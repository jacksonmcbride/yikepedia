# Central Park

Some days are made for doing *nothing*, but somehow end up meaning *everything*. That was Central Park for us. It was one of those perfect spring afternoons—sunny but not sweaty, romantic but not try-hard. Claire and I wandered into the idea of boating like it was the most natural thing in the world.

## The Row Boat

Neither of us had rowed in a while (or ever?), but Claire took to it immediately—like she’d been training secretly for a rowboat Olympics. I gave it my best, and together, we had this rhythm that actually felt kind of impressive. If you squinted, we might’ve looked like professionals. (Except for this *one guy* was going nuts. He was dual weilding the oars, and was flying across the water.)

We glided past turtles sunbathing on rocks—little zen kings doing exactly what we wanted to be doing. There were these sleek birds nearby (geese? swans? we didn’t know), adding to the dreamy aesthetic. But the real plot twist came when another couple in a nearby boat started yelling at someone onshore. Total chaos. It felt like we were the chill main characters witnessing the drama unfold.

The best part though? It was just *easy*. Not the rowing—that actually worked our arms—but being with Claire. We joked, we drifted, we soaked up the sun. And if we were the fastest boat out there? Well… I won’t argue.

## Sweet Break & Citibike Chase

After docking, we went for a little walk to grab sweets (because vibes are better when you're a little sugared up). But we weren’t done with the park yet—not even close.

We came back later for a full *Citibike lap*. And let me tell you: **I LOVE Citibiking**. I was thrilled Claire was down. We got the electric ones (obviously), and once we took off, it was game on. We zoomed past every tourist, every stroller, every lost jogger. We weren’t even talking much, but honestly? It didn’t matter.

Sometimes silence says more. We were just there—flying side by side. That kind of quiet connection hits different.

## Atmosphere

The park itself was stunning—lush, green, and full of life. But what really stood out was the balance of energy. One moment felt like a romantic movie montage, the next like a two-person race no one else knew they were in. The mix of chill and fun, of quiet laughs and chaotic yelling couples, made the whole experience unforgettable.

## Final Thoughts

Central Park isn’t exactly a hidden gem, but it still surprises you—especially when you’ve got the right person to explore it with. Whether you're rowing through sunshine and turtles or racing strangers on electric bikes, it’s the kind of day that sticks with you.

**Verdict:** 8.5/10  
Would return for another lap (and another boat ride). Claire’s rowing form is undefeated.
