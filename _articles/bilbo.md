# Café Bilboquet

**Café Bilboquet** is the casual, elegant offshoot of the iconic Le Bilboquet French bistro—a refined patisserie that opened in 2018 as a more accessible way to experience the Bilboquet brand. Claire and I stopped by after work one day, and even though our visit was brief, it left a lasting impression.

The space channels the charm of its parent restaurant with vintage-style tiling, velvet banquettes, and elegant display cases filled with French pastries. It's designed for quick but stylish experiences—perfect for a coffee, snack, or light lunch without the formality of a full dining experience.

## The Experience

Walking in, you immediately feel transported to a cozy Parisian café. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, with that unmistakable French hospitality. The display cases showcase an impressive selection of viennoiseries, macarons, éclairs, and tarts that look almost too beautiful to eat.

I ordered the **pistachio croissant**, which was absolutely divine—flaky, buttery, and with just the right amount of pistachio flavor. Claire got some kind of dessert that looked equally impressive, though I was too focused on my own pastry to pay much attention to hers.

The staff was friendly and mostly French-speaking, which added to the authentic European café feel. Even though we only had a brief visit, the quality of the pastries and the cozy ambiance made it feel like a proper treat.

## The Menu & Offerings

Café Bilboquet offers a curated selection of French-style pastries, including their standout cookie-dough croissant, rich chocolate éclairs, and Lorraine quiche. For savory options, they serve croque-monsieur, quiche, frittata, and various sandwiches with options like Brie-and-honey, foie gras, and caprese.

The beverage selection ranges from espresso-based drinks and quality coffee to beer, wine, and champagne—perfect for both quick coffee breaks and small celebratory moments.

## Final Thoughts

Café Bilboquet strikes that perfect balance between casual and refined. It's the kind of place where you can grab a quick pastry and coffee, or linger over a glass of champagne. The quality of the pastries is exceptional, and the atmosphere feels genuinely French without being pretentious.

**Verdict:** 8/10  
Excellent pastries, cozy atmosphere, and a perfect spot for a refined café experience.
